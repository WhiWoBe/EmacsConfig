1. Use a Link to the current buffer and capture to a todo list
   file ~buffer-name~ returns the current buffer name. Careful when
   opened with dired the buffer name gets extended with <2>

2. Query for files with todo items

3. Mark files with todo items on save and add them to the agenda file list

4. Use the Org Roam method where todo items in the current file are tagged
   and then referenced by the agenda
